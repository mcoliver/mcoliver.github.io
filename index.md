Hello. Since 2005 I have been [designing, building, and leading high performance global]({{ site.urls.linkedin }})
- **Infrastructure**
- **Teams**
- **Data Pipelines**

That power your favorite Hollywood film and television.

My career has focused on emerging technologies, networking, security, distributed compute and storage clusters, high performance storage and compute, data pipelines, animation, vfx, virtual production, and workflow automation.  Leveraging technology to empower creatives to realize their visions.

## My Core Tenants
I have done a lot over my career in various capacities but the underlying themes of how I operate are:
- **Always Deliver**
- **Constant Curiosity**
- **Complete Accountability**
- **Total Transparency**
- **Data informed decisions**
- **Candor with Empathy**

I keep up to date with the latest and greatest products, technologies, and techniques through my network and by getting my hands dirty.  And I pair that with a practical KISS focus and process that zeros in on results rather than the allure of shiny objects.

## Constant Curiosity
When I am not focused on my young family, I write code for fun, read daily, take things apart and put them back together again, surf, and run. Interests include macroeconmic finance, high performance teams, bioinformatics and genomics, artifical intelligence, the evolution of networks and computing, 19th century US history, and historical expeditions and exploration.

## Fun facts
I was once a [FBI agent]({{ site.urls.imdb }}) on the TV show Criminal Minds, have driven the entire coast of Ecuador, and traveled the entire Baja peninsula by both boat and car.

## Random Side Projects for Fun
